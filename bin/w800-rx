# ABSTRACT: simple example script to read from a W800 receiver
# PODNAME: w800-rx

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # read from USB tty device
  w800-rx /dev/ttyUSB0

  # read from USB device with nicer name see Device::W800(3)
  w800-rx /dev/w800-rx

  # read from network/wireless device
  w800-rx 10.0.0.1:10001

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is an example of the usage of the L<Device::W800> API.  It
simply initializes the receiver and writes a summary of the received
RF messages to stdout.  The keys and values given on the command line
become the parameter hash for the L<Device::W800#new> constructor and
are documented in that module.
